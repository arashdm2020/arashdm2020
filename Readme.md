# Arash Dolati Mehr 👋
**Senior Backend & Web3 Engineer** • Go / Solidity • Distributed Systems • Security-minded ⚙️🔐

I build **production-grade Web3 backends** and **EVM smart contracts** for NFT, DeFi, and protocol-level products — with a focus on **scalability**, **clear state design**, and **operational reliability**.

---

## What I do best ✨
- 🧱 **Backend architecture**: event-driven services, APIs, caching, queues, data modeling
- 🔐 **Smart contracts**: security-first Solidity, audit readiness, upgrade strategy (when justified)
- ⛽ **Gas optimization**: architecture-first, not micro-tricks
- 🌐 **Distributed systems**: reliability, failure modes, observability, boring-but-solid design

---

## Tech I actually use 🧰
**Core:** Go, Solidity, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, PHP (Laravel)  
**Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS  
**Web3:** Web3.js / Ethers, EVM tooling, onchain/offchain modeling

---

## Writing 📝
- **Practical Gas Optimization in Solidity: Lessons from Production Systems**
- **If We Designed Proof of Work Today, It Would Look Nothing Like Bitcoin Mining**

> I publish technical notes and long-form engineering articles focused on production realities.

### Fun fact ⚡
I enjoy turning complex blockchain systems into **simple, boring, reliable designs** — because boring systems are the ones that survive mainnet 😄
